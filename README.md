# VET_GPT
This project outlines a PyTorch-based GPT model that is trained to answer questions about "cats and dogs" using data from a text file (`cats_and_dogs_data.txt`). The model is built using a transformer architecture and incorporates a question-answering (Q&amp;A) function, which provides responses based on matching keywords from the input question.
